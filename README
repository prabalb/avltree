An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. In such a tree, the difference between the heights of two child sub-trees of any node, i.e, balance factor should not be more than 1. If anytime this balance factor is more than 1, then re-balancing of the tree should be performed. The re-balancing of the tree is done by one or more tree rotations. To understand tree-rotations better: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_rotation.

--- Program an AVL Tree that can perform the following actions:
 - Creating tree
 - Insertion of a node
 - Deletion of a node
 - Searching a node
 - Deleting Tree
 - Traversal of the tree - Pre-order, Post-order and In-order
 - Check Balance

To understand these actions more clearly, you can view this AVL link: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html
(You choose the step-by-step in "options" tab to understand each step clearly)

Source files: wrapper.h, AVLTree.h, AVLTree.cpp, main.cpp
Makefile: makefile
Executable: avlexec
How to compile and generate an executable: Type make and hit return (in the same directory as that of the makefile and source code)
How to execute the program: ./avlexec
Input file: input.txt
Output file: Basu-A02049867.txt

Assumptions: 
 - Height of a tree increases in a bottom-up fashion, height of a leaf node is assumed to be '1'. 
 - The output file will be generated in the current working directory.
